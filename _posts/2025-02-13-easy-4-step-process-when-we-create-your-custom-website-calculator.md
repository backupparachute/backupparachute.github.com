# The Easy 4 Step Process When We Create Your Custom Website Calculator

Ever wondered how to add a tool to your website that not only crunches numbers but also drives traffic and boosts your SEO? At Backup Parachute Software, we create custom website calculators that do exactly that. Best of all, we work on a flat rate basis with no hidden fees or surprises. Let us show you our easy 4 step process in a fun and straightforward way.

## Step 1: Send Us Your Spreadsheet

It all begins with your spreadsheet. Think of it as your treasure map. You send us the details, formulas, and logic that you want your calculator to work with. Whether it is a simple conversion tool or a complex financial estimator, your spreadsheet holds the secret ingredients. No rocket science here, just clear instructions and numbers, and we will take it from there. We pride ourselves on making the process as simple as possible so that you can focus on what matters most: your business.

## Step 2: We Build the First Version

Once we have your spreadsheet, our team of calculator wizards gets to work. We craft the first version of your calculator and deploy it on our site for a live demo. This early version lets you see your tool in action and ensures that we are on the same page. It is like getting a sneak peek of a blockbuster before its big premiere. During this phase, we focus on functionality so that every calculation works perfectly. We even test it with real numbers to make sure the math is spot on.

## Step 3: Iteration Time

Now comes the fun part: iteration. We know that the first version is just the beginning. We work closely with you to fine tune both the functionality and the visual design of your calculator. Do you want a more modern look? Need the results to display in a certain style? We adjust the design and tweak the calculations until everything is exactly how you envision it. Think of it as a custom makeover for your calculator, only without any bad hair days. This collaborative process ensures that the final tool is not only accurate but also delightful to use.

## Step 4: Final Approval and Embedding

When you are completely happy with the final version, we move to the grand finale: embedding the calculator on your website. We offer two smooth options:
- We provide your web team with detailed instructions and any extra help they may need to integrate the calculator seamlessly.
- Alternatively, you can give us access, and we will handle the embedding for you—all at no additional cost.

Our goal is to make the transition effortless so that you get a fully functional, gorgeous calculator that fits perfectly into your website’s design and workflow.
